# Aurora Hive
**The simplest way to access your AUR wallet at any time on your desktop computer.** Currently working on OSX/macOS but you should be perfectly fine with building it for windows or linux too. Please let me know of any [issues]() or success!
Access your Auroracoin hive wallet ([hive.auroracoin.is](hive.auroracoin.is)) straight from your menubar!
It would need some testing, but if you have no hive wallet yet, you should be able to set one up within the menubar app.
