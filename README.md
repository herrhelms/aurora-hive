# Aurora Hive
**The simplest way to access your AUR wallet at any time on your desktop computer.**

Currently working on OSX/macOS but you should be able to build this for windows or linux too.
Access your Auroracoin hive wallet ([hive.auroracoin.is](hive.auroracoin.is)) in no time from your menubar!
If you have no hive wallet yet, no worries! You can set one up within the menubar app.
